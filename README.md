# Modderphorin
Modderphorin will be a rewrite of the utility known as Semaphorin which is a utility that would downgrade your 64 bit iOS devices
So far this script is untested but it should work with downgrading the iPhone 5s (6,1) to iOS 7.1.2 and 7.0.6

# Prereq
Make sure your device is jailbroken with both openSSH and mterminal installed

# Running the script

Install xcode command line tools

`xcode-select install`

Then clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/Switch-modder/Modderphorin`

Mark both scripts as executable by doing 

`chmod +x script.sh`

And

`chmod +x clean.sh`

Now plug in the iPhone in DFU mode and run

`./script.sh`

When it asks the version choose either 7.1.2 or 7.0.6

If the script asks for any password it should be either your Mac password or the SSH password `alpine`
